#### iOS Pythonista today widget that shows bus ETA.

The main idea is to have a widget that shows you ETA of buses you interested in, for example it maybe useful if you
 used to get to work and back home on a bus, so you can get ETA of buses to home when you are at work and ETA of
 buses to work and you are at home.
   
##### TO DO: Add screenshots here

This will only work with [Pythonista 3](http://omz-software.com/pythonista/).

#### Caution: Pythonista 2 is not supported!

In order to make it work, you need to use [stash](https://github.com/ywangd/stash) 

Please for follow the instructions in https://github.com/ywangd/stash to have a working pip in Pythonista 3. 

You also need coordinates of bus stations you going to get information about. Refer to [Get the coordinates of a
 place](https://support.google.com/maps/answer/18539) section instructions to the exact coordinates.

##### TO DO:

- [] Add support for better station detection for example if  home and work are in the same city
